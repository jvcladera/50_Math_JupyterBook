## 44 Money mathematics

**Money mathematics, or financial mathematics, applies mathematical tools and concepts to analyze financial markets, manage risk, and make informed investment decisions. From simple interest calculations to complex derivatives pricing, mathematics provides the framework for understanding the dynamics of money over time.**

### Simple Interest

Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount. It's the easiest to calculate and is often used for short-term loans or investments.

`Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time`

Where:
*   Principal (P): The initial amount of money.
*   Rate (R): The annual interest rate (as a decimal).
*   Time (T): The time period in years.

### Compound Interest

Compound interest is calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This means that interest earns interest, leading to exponential growth. It's often called the "eighth wonder of the world" due to its powerful effect.

`Compound Amount = Principal × (1 + Rate/n)^(n*Time)`

Where:
*   Principal (P): The initial amount of money.
*   Rate (R): The annual interest rate (as a decimal).
*   Time (T): The time period in years.
*   n: The number of times that interest is compounded per year.

### Present Value and Future Value

*   **Future Value (FV):** The value of an asset or cash at a specified time in the future, based on a particular rate of growth.
*   **Present Value (PV):** The current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows, given a specified rate of return.

These concepts are crucial for financial planning, investment analysis, and valuing assets.

### Annuities and Loans

*   **Annuity:** A series of equal payments made at regular intervals over a period of time. Examples include loan payments, insurance premiums, and retirement payouts.
*   **Loan Amortization:** The process of paying off a debt over time through regular payments, where each payment consists of both principal and interest.

### Risk and Return

Financial mathematics also deals with quantifying risk and return. Concepts like standard deviation are used to measure the volatility of investments, while expected return helps in evaluating potential gains.

### Applications of Money Mathematics

*   **Personal Finance:** Budgeting, saving, investing, and retirement planning.
*   **Banking and Lending:** Calculating interest on loans and deposits, risk assessment.
*   **Investment Management:** Portfolio optimization, derivatives pricing, risk management.
*   **Corporate Finance:** Capital budgeting, valuation, mergers and acquisitions.
*   **Insurance:** Actuarial science, pricing policies, managing reserves.

# Python demo: Compound Interest Calculation

def calculate_compound_interest(principal, annual_rate, years, compounds_per_year):
    # A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)
    # A = final amount
    # P = principal amount
    # r = annual interest rate (as a decimal)
    # n = number of times interest is compounded per year
    # t = number of years
    
    rate_per_compound = annual_rate / compounds_per_year
    total_compounds = compounds_per_year * years
    
    final_amount = principal * (1 + rate_per_compound)**total_compounds
    return final_amount

# Example usage:
principal_amount = 1000  # $1000
interest_rate = 0.05     # 5% annual interest
time_years = 10          # 10 years

# Compounded annually (n=1)
final_annually = calculate_compound_interest(principal_amount, interest_rate, time_years, 1)
print(f"Amount after {time_years} years (compounded annually): ${final_annually:.2f}")

# Compounded semi-annually (n=2)
final_semi_annually = calculate_compound_interest(principal_amount, interest_rate, time_years, 2)
print(f"Amount after {time_years} years (compounded semi-annually): ${final_semi_annually:.2f}")

# Compounded quarterly (n=4)
final_quarterly = calculate_compound_interest(principal_amount, interest_rate, time_years, 4)
print(f"Amount after {time_years} years (compounded quarterly): ${final_quarterly:.2f}")

# Compounded monthly (n=12)
final_monthly = calculate_compound_interest(principal_amount, interest_rate, time_years, 12)
print(f"Amount after {time_years} years (compounded monthly): ${final_monthly:.2f}")

# Compounded daily (n=365)
final_daily = calculate_compound_interest(principal_amount, interest_rate, time_years, 365)
print(f"Amount after {time_years} years (compounded daily): ${final_daily:.2f}")
