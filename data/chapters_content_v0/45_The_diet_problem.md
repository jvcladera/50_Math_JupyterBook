## 45 The diet problem

**The Diet Problem is a classic optimization problem in mathematics, particularly in the field of linear programming. It seeks to find the cheapest combination of foods that satisfies a set of nutritional requirements. This problem, while seemingly simple, laid the groundwork for powerful optimization techniques used in various industries today.**

### Problem Formulation

The Diet Problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem:

*   **Objective Function:** Minimize the total cost of the diet.
*   **Decision Variables:** The quantities of each food item to be consumed.
*   **Constraints:** Nutritional requirements (e.g., minimum daily intake of vitamins, maximum intake of fats) and non-negativity constraints (cannot consume negative amounts of food).

Mathematically, it looks like this:

Minimize: `C1*x1 + C2*x2 + ... + Cn*xn` (Total Cost)

Subject to:
*   `A11*x1 + A12*x2 + ... + A1n*xn >= R1` (Nutrient 1 requirement)
*   `A21*x1 + A22*x2 + ... + A2n*xn >= R2` (Nutrient 2 requirement)
*   ... (and so on for all nutrients)
*   `x1, x2, ..., xn >= 0` (Non-negativity)

Where:
*   `Ci` is the cost per unit of food `i`.
*   `xi` is the quantity of food `i`.
*   `Aij` is the amount of nutrient `j` in one unit of food `i`.
*   `Rj` is the minimum required amount of nutrient `j`.

### History

The Diet Problem gained prominence during World War II when the U.S. Army sought to determine the cheapest way to feed soldiers while meeting their nutritional needs. George Stigler, an economist, worked on this problem in 1945, finding a solution using a trial-and-error method. His solution, while close to optimal, was not the absolute minimum cost. The problem was later fully solved using the newly developed technique of linear programming.

### Linear Programming

The Diet Problem is a prime example of a linear programming problem. Linear programming is a mathematical method for determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. It is a powerful tool in operations research and has applications in:

*   **Resource Allocation:** Optimizing the use of limited resources.
*   **Production Planning:** Determining optimal production levels.
*   **Transportation:** Finding the most efficient routes.
*   **Scheduling:** Creating optimal schedules for tasks or personnel.

# Python demo: Simple Diet Problem using SciPy's linear programming solver

# This example demonstrates a very simplified version of the diet problem.
# It requires the SciPy library (pip install scipy).

from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Objective function coefficients (costs of foods)
# Let's say we have two foods: Food A and Food B
# Cost of Food A per unit: $2
# Cost of Food B per unit: $3
c = [2, 3]  # Coefficients for x1 (Food A) and x2 (Food B)

# Inequality constraints matrix (nutritional requirements)
# Let's say we need:
# - At least 10 units of Nutrient 1
# - At least 8 units of Nutrient 2
# Food A provides: 1 unit of N1, 2 units of N2
# Food B provides: 3 units of N1, 1 unit of N2
A_ub = [
    [-1, -3],  # -x1 - 3x2 <= -10  (equivalent to x1 + 3x2 >= 10 for Nutrient 1)
    [-2, -1]   # -2x1 - x2 <= -8   (equivalent to 2x1 + x2 >= 8 for Nutrient 2)
]

b_ub = [-10, -8] # Right-hand side of the inequalities

# Bounds for variables (quantities of food must be non-negative)
x0_bounds = (0, None) # x1 >= 0
x1_bounds = (0, None) # x2 >= 0

# Solve the linear programming problem
res = linprog(c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, bounds=[x0_bounds, x1_bounds], method='highs')

print("Simple Diet Problem Optimization Results:")
if res.success:
    print(f"Optimal cost: ${res.fun:.2f}")
    print(f"Quantity of Food A (x1): {res.x[0]:.2f} units")
    print(f"Quantity of Food B (x2): {res.x[1]:.2f} units")
else:
    print("Optimization failed:", res.message)

# Note: This is a very basic example. Real-world diet problems can involve
# many more food items, nutrients, and complex constraints.
