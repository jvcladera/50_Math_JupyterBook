## 04 Squares and square roots

**If you like making squares with dots, your thought patterns are similar to those of the
Pythagoreans. This activity was prized by the fraternity who followed their leader
Pythagoras, a man best remembered for ‘that theorem’. He was born on the Greek
island of Samos and his secret religious society thrived in southern Italy. Pythagoreans
believed mathematics was the key to the nature of the universe.**

Counting up the dots, we see the first ‘square’ on the left is made from one
dot. To the Pythagoreans 1 was the most important number, imbued with
spiritual existence. So we’ve made a good start. Continuing to count up the dots
of the subsequent squares gives us the ‘square’ numbers, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49,
64,... These are called ‘perfect’ squares. You can compute a square number by
adding the dots on the shape ⌉ outside the previous one, for example 9 +
7 =

16. The Pythagoreans didn’t stop with squares. They considered other shapes,
such as triangles, pentagons (the figure with five sides) and other polygonal
(many-sided) shapes.

The triangular numbers resemble a pile of stones. Counting these dots gives
us 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, ... If you want to compute a triangular number
you can use the previous one and add the number of dots in the last row. What
is the triangular number which comes after 10, for instance? It will have 5 dots in
the last row so we just add 10 + 5 = 15.
If you compare the square and triangular numbers you will see that the


number 36 appears in both lists. But there is a more striking link. If you take
successive triangular numbers and add them together, what do you get? Let’s try
it and put the results in a table.

```
Adding two successive triangular numbers
```
That’s right! When you add two successive triangular numbers together you
get a square number. You can also see this with a ‘proof without words’.
Consider a square made up of 4 rows of 4 dots with a diagonal line drawn
through it. The dots above the line (shown) form a triangular number and below
the line is the next triangular number. This observation holds for any sized
square. It’s a short step from these ‘dotty diagrams’ to measuring areas. The area
of a square whose side is 4 is 4 × 4 = 4^2 = 16 square units. In general, if the
side is called x then the area will be x^2.

The square x^2 is the basis for the parabolic shape. This is the shape you find
in satellite receiver dishes or the reflector mirrors of car headlights. A parabola
has a focus point. In a receiving dish a sensor placed at the focus receives the


reflected signals when parallel beams from space hit the curved dish and bounce
towards the focus point.
In a car headlight a light bulb at the focus sends out a parallel beam of light.
In sport, shot-putters, javelin throwers and hammer throwers will all recognize
the parabola as the shape of the curved path that every object follows as it falls
to the Earth.

### Square roots

If we turn the question around and want to find the length of a square which
has a given area 16, the answer is plainly 4. The square root of 16 is 4 and
written as. The symbol √ for square roots has been employed since the
1500s. All the square numbers have nice whole numbers as square roots. For
example, , , , , , and so on. There are though
many gaps along the numbers line between these perfect squares. These are 2,
3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, ...

There is a brilliant piece of alternative notation for square roots. Just as x^2
denotes a square number, we can write a square root number as x **½** , which fits in
with the device of multiplying numbers together by adding powers. This is the
basis for logarithms, invented after we learnt in around 1600 that a problem in
multiplication could be changed into one of addition. But that is another story.


These numbers all have square roots, but they are not equal to whole numbers.
Virtually all calculators have a √ button, and using it we find, for instance,

.
Let’s look at. The number 2 had special significance for the Pythagoreans
because it is the first even number (the Greeks thought of the even numbers as
feminine and the odd ones as masculine – and the small numbers had distinct
personalities). If you work out on your calculator you will get 1.414213562
assuming your calculator gives this many decimal places. Is this the square root
of 2? To check we make the calculation 1.414213562 × 1.414213562. This turns
out to be 1.999999999. This is not quite 2 for 1.414213562 is only an
approximation for the square root of 2.
What is perhaps remarkable is that all we will ever get is an approximation!
The decimal expansion of to millions of decimal places will only ever be an
approximation. The number is important in mathematics, perhaps not quite
as illustrious as π or e (see pages 20– 27 ) but important enough to gets its own
name – it is sometimes called the ‘Pythagorean number’.

### Are square roots fractions?

Asking whether square roots are fractions is linked to the theory of
measurement as known to the ancient Greeks. Suppose we have a line AB whose
length we wish to measure, and an indivisible ‘unit’ CD with which to measure it.
To make the measurement we place the unit CD sequentially against AB. If we
place the unit down m times and the end of the last unit fits flush with the end of
AB (at the point B) then the length of AB will simply be m. If not we can place a
copy of AB next to the original and carry on measuring with the unit (see figure).
The Greeks believed that at some point using n copies of AB and m units, the


unit would fit flush with the end-point of the mth AB. The length of AB would
then be m/n. For example if 3 copies of AB are laid side by side and 29 units fit
alongside, the length of AB would be 29/3.

The Greeks also considered how to measure the length of the side AB (the
hypotenuse) of a triangle where both of the other sides are one ‘unit’ long. By
Pythagoras’s theorem the length of AB could be written symbolically as so the

question is whether?
From our calculator, we have already seen that the decimal expression for
is potentially infinite, and this fact (that there is no end to the decimal
expression) perhaps indicates that is not a fraction. But there is no end to the
decimal 0.3333333... and that represents the fraction ⅓. We need more
convincing arguments.

### Is a fraction?

This brings us to one of the most famous proofs in mathematics. It follows
the lines of the type of proof which the Greeks loved: the method of reductio ad
absurdum. Firstly it is assumed that cannot be a fraction and ‘not a fraction’ at
the same time. This is the law of logic called the ‘excluded middle’. There is no
middle way in this logic. So what the Greeks did was ingenious. They assumed
that it was a fraction and, by strict logic at every step, derived a contradiction, an
‘absurdity’. So let’s do it. Suppose We can assume a bit more too.


We can assume that m and n have no common factors. This is OK because if
they did have common factors these could be cancelled before we began. (For
example, the fraction 21/35 is equivalent to the factorless ⅗ on cancellation of
the common factor 7.)

```
We can square both sides of to get 2 = m
```
```
2
/n 2 and so m^2 = 2n^2. Here is
```
where we make our first observation: since m^2 is 2 times something it must be
an even number. Next m itself cannot be odd (because the square of an odd
number is odd) and so m is also an even number.
So far the logic is impeccable. As m is even it must be twice something which
we can write as m = 2k. Squaring both sides of this means that m^2 = 4k^2.
Combining this with the fact that m^2 = 2n^2 means that 2n^2 = 4k^2 and on
cancellation of 2 we conclude that n^2 = 2k^2. But we have been here before! And
as before we conclude that n^2 is even and n itself is even. We have thus deduced
by strict logic that both m and n are both even and so they have a factor of 2 in
common. This was contrary to our assumption that m and n have no common
factors. The conclusion therefore is that cannot be a fraction.
It can also be proved that the whole sequence of numbers √n (except where n
is a perfect square) cannot be fractions. Numbers which cannot be expressed as
fractions are called ‘irrational’ numbers, so we have observed there are an infinite
number of irrational numbers.
