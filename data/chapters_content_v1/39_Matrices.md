# 39 Matrices

**Matrices** are rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. They are fundamental mathematical objects used to represent **linear transformations**, solve **systems of linear equations**, and organize data in various fields, from computer graphics and physics to economics and machine learning.

## Basic Concepts

*   **Elements:** The individual entries within a matrix.
*   **Dimensions:** A matrix is described by its number of rows (*m*) and columns (*n*), denoted as an *m x n* matrix.
*   **Square Matrix:** A matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns (*m = n*).
*   **Identity Matrix:** A square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere, denoted as *I*. It acts like the number *1* in matrix multiplication.
*   **Zero Matrix:** A matrix where all elements are zero.

## Matrix Operations

*   **Addition and Subtraction:** Matrices of the same dimensions can be added or subtracted by adding or subtracting their corresponding elements.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a matrix by a single number (**scalar**) involves multiplying every element in the matrix by that scalar.
*   **Matrix Multiplication:** The product of two matrices *A* (*m x n*) and *B* (*n x p*) is a new matrix *C* (*m x p*). This operation is more complex than element-wise multiplication and involves **dot products** of rows and columns. Matrix multiplication is generally **not commutative** (*A × B ≠ B × A*).
*   **Transpose:** The transpose of a matrix *A*, denoted *Aᵀ*, is obtained by flipping the matrix over its diagonal, effectively swapping row and column indices.
*   **Determinant:** A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It provides information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible.
*   **Inverse Matrix:** For a square matrix *A*, its inverse *A⁻¹* is a matrix such that *A × A⁻¹ = A⁻¹ × A = I* (the identity matrix). Not all matrices have an inverse.

## Applications of Matrices

Matrices are incredibly versatile and have applications in almost every quantitative field:

*   **Solving Systems of Linear Equations:** Matrices provide a compact and efficient way to represent and solve systems of linear equations.
*   **Computer Graphics:** Used for transformations like translation, rotation, scaling, and projection in *2D* and *3D* graphics.
*   **Physics and Engineering:** Representing transformations, forces, and stresses.
*   **Economics:** Input-output models, game theory.
*   **Machine Learning and Data Science:** Fundamental to algorithms in **linear regression, neural networks, principal component analysis**, and more.
*   **Cryptography:** Used in various encryption and decryption algorithms.

# Python demo: Basic Matrix Operations using NumPy

import numpy as np

# Define two matrices
A = np.array([[
1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

B = np.array([[
9, 8, 7],
              [6, 5, 4],
              [3, 2, 1]])

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("\nMatrix B:\n", B)

# Matrix Addition
C_add = A + B
print("\nMatrix A + B:\n", C_add)

# Matrix Subtraction
C_sub = A - B
print("\nMatrix A - B:\n", C_sub)

# Scalar Multiplication
scalar = 2
C_scalar = scalar * A
print(f"\nMatrix {scalar} * A:\n", C_scalar)

# Matrix Multiplication (dot product)
# Note: For A @ B, the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B.
# Here, both are 3x3, so it works.
C_mul = A @ B
print("\nMatrix A @ B (dot product):\n", C_mul)

# Transpose of a Matrix
A_T = A.T
print("\nTranspose of A (A.T):\n", A_T)

# Determinant of a Matrix
# For this example, A is singular (determinant is 0), so it doesn't have an inverse.
# Let's use a different matrix for inverse demonstration.

D = np.array([[
4, 7],
              [2, 6]])
print("\nMatrix D:\n", D)

det_D = np.linalg.det(D)
print(f"Determinant of D: {det_D:.2f}")

# Inverse of a Matrix
# Check if determinant is non-zero before calculating inverse
if np.linalg.det(D) != 0:
    D_inv = np.linalg.inv(D)
    print("Inverse of D (D_inv):\n", D_inv)
    print("D @ D_inv (should be identity matrix):\n", D @ D_inv)
else:
    print("Matrix D is singular and does not have an inverse.")

# Note: This example requires NumPy to be installed.
# You can install it using: pip install: pip install numpy
