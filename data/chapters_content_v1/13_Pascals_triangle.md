# 13 Pascal’s triangle

The number **1** is important but what about **11**? It is interesting too and so is *11 × 11 = 121*, *11 × 11 × 11 = 1331* and *11 × 11 × 11 × 11 = 14,641*. Setting these out we get

These are the first lines of **Pascal’s triangle**. But where do we find it?

Throwing in *11⁰ = 1* for good measure, the first thing to do is forget the commas, and then introduce spaces between the numbers. So *14,641* becomes *1 4 6 4 1*.

**Pascal’s triangle** is famous in mathematics for its **symmetry** and **hidden relationships**. In *1653* **Blaise Pascal** thought so and remarked that he could not possibly cover them all in one paper. The many connections of Pascal’s triangle with other branches of mathematics have made it into a venerable mathematical object, but its origins can be traced back much further than this. In fact Pascal didn’t invent the triangle named after him – it was known to **Chinese scholars** of the *13th century*.

The Pascal pattern is generated from the top. Start with a *1* and place two *1s* on either side of it in the next row down. To construct further rows we continue to place *1s* on the ends of each row while the internal numbers are obtained by the sum of the two numbers immediately above. To obtain *6* in the fifth row for example, we add *3 + 3* from the row above. The English mathematician **G.H. Hardy** said ‘*a mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns*’ and Pascal’s triangle has patterns in spades.

## Links with algebra

Pascal’s triangle is founded on real mathematics. If we work out *(1 + x) × (1 + x) × (1 + x) = (1 + x)³*, for example, we get *1 + 3x + 3x² + x³*. Look closely and you’ll see the numbers in front of the symbols in this expression match the numbers in the corresponding row of Pascal’s triangle. The scheme followed is:

If we add up the numbers in any row of Pascal’s triangle we always obtain a power of *2*. For example in the fifth row down *1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 16 = 2⁴*. This can be obtained from the left-hand column above if we use *x = 1*.

## Properties

The first and most obvious property of Pascal’s triangle is its **symmetry**. If we draw a vertical line down through the middle, the triangle has ‘**mirror symmetry**’ - it is the same to the left of the vertical line as to the right of it. This allows us to talk about plain ‘**diagonals**’, because a northeast diagonal will be the same as a northwest diagonal. Under the diagonal made up of *1s* we have the diagonal made up of the **counting numbers** *1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...*. Under that there are the **triangular numbers**, *1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,...* (the numbers which can be made up of dots in the form of triangles). In the diagonal under that we have the **tetrahedral numbers**, *1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56,...*. These numbers correspond to **tetrahedra** (‘three-dimensional triangles’, or, if you like, the number of cannon balls which can be placed on triangular bases of increasing sizes). And what about the ‘**almost diagonals**’?

If we add up the numbers in lines across the triangle (which are not rows or true diagonals), we get the sequence *1, 2, 5, 13, 34,...*. Each number is three times the previous one with the one before that subtracted. For example *34 = 3 × 13 – 5*. Based on this, the next number in the sequence will be *3 × 34 – 13 = 89*. We have missed out the alternate ‘almost diagonals’, starting with *1, 1 + 2 = 3*, but these will give us the sequence ***1, 3, 8, 21, 55,...*** and these are generated by the same ‘*3 times minus 1*’ rule. We can therefore generate the next number in the sequence, as *3 × 55 – 21 = **144***. But there’s more. If we interleave these two sequences of ‘almost diagonals’ we get the **Fibonacci numbers**:

*1, **1**, 2, **3**, 5, **8**, 13, **21**, 34, **55**, 89, **144**,...*
