# 37 Genetics

**Genetics**, the study of **heredity** and **variation** in living organisms, is deeply intertwined with mathematics. From **Gregor Mendel's** pioneering work on pea plants to modern **population genetics** and **bioinformatics**, mathematical principles are essential for understanding how traits are passed down through generations and how genetic information shapes life.

## Mendelian Genetics

**Gregor Mendel**, an Austrian monk, laid the foundation for modern genetics in the mid-*19th century* through his experiments with pea plants. He discovered fundamental laws of inheritance:

*   **Law of Segregation:** Each individual possesses two alleles for a particular trait, and each parent passes only one allele to their offspring.
*   **Law of Independent Assortment:** Alleles for different traits are inherited independently of each other.

These laws can be modeled using simple **probability** and **Punnett squares** to predict the **genotypes** and **phenotypes** of offspring.

## Probability in Genetics

Probability plays a crucial role in genetics:

*   **Predicting Offspring Ratios:** Using probability, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting specific traits.
*   **Genetic Counseling:** Assessing the risk of genetic disorders.
*   **Population Genetics:** Studying the distribution and changes in allele frequencies within populations over time.

## DNA and Information Theory

The discovery of the structure of **DNA** by **Watson** and **Crick** in *1953* revealed a molecular basis for heredity. The **genetic code**, which dictates how DNA sequences are translated into proteins, can be analyzed using concepts from **information theory**, a branch of mathematics dealing with the quantification, storage, and communication of information.

## Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

Modern genetics relies heavily on computational tools and mathematical algorithms. **Bioinformatics** is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, particularly large and complex datasets generated by **genomics** and **proteomics**. This includes:

*   **Sequence Alignment:** Comparing DNA or protein sequences to find similarities and evolutionary relationships.
*   **Phylogenetic Tree Construction:** Building evolutionary trees to show the relationships between different species.
*   **Genome Assembly:** Reconstructing entire genomes from fragmented DNA sequences.

import random

def simulate_monohybrid_cross(parent1_genotype, parent2_genotype, num_offspring):
    # Assumes dominant/recessive inheritance for a single gene
    # Genotypes are represented as strings, e.g., 'Aa', 'AA', 'aa'

    alleles_p1 = [parent1_genotype[0], parent1_genotype[1]]
    alleles_p2 = [parent2_genotype[0], parent2_genotype[1]]

    offspring_genotypes = []
    for _ in range(num_offspring):
        # Randomly select one allele from each parent
        offspring_allele1 = random.choice(alleles_p1)
        offspring_allele2 = random.choice(alleles_p2)
        
        # Combine alleles and sort to standardize genotype representation
        genotype = ''.join(sorted([offspring_allele1, offspring_allele2]))
        offspring_genotypes.append(genotype)
    
    return offspring_genotypes

# Example: Cross between two heterozygous parents (Aa x Aa)
parent1 = 'Aa'
parent2 = 'Aa'
num_babies = 1000

offspring = simulate_monohybrid_cross(parent1, parent2, num_babies)

# Count genotypes
genotype_counts = {'AA': 0, 'Aa': 0, 'aa': 0}
for gen in offspring:
    if gen in genotype_counts:
        genotype_counts[gen] += 1

print(f"Simulating {parent1} x {parent2} cross for {num_babies} offspring:")
for genotype, count in genotype_counts.items():
    print(f"  Genotype {genotype}: {count} ({count/num_babies:.2%})")

# Expected Mendelian ratios for Aa x Aa: 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa
print("\nExpected Mendelian Ratios (approx): AA: 25%, Aa: 50%, aa: 25%")
