# 12 Golden rectangles

**Rectangles** are all around us – buildings, photographs, windows, doors, even this book. Rectangles are present within the artists’ community – **Piet Mondrian, Ben Nicholson** and others, who progressed to abstraction, all used one sort or another. So which is the most beautiful of all? Is it a long thin ‘*Giacometti rectangle*’ or one that is almost a square? Or is it a rectangle in between these extremes?

Does the question even make sense? Some think so, and believe particular rectangles are more ‘ideal’ than others. Of these, perhaps the **golden rectangle** has found greatest favour. Amongst all the rectangles one could choose for their different proportions – for that is what it comes down to – the golden rectangle is a very special one which has inspired artists, architects and mathematicians.

## Mathematical paper

If we take a piece of **A4 paper**, whose dimensions are a short side of *210 mm* and a long side of *297 mm*, the length-to-width ratio will be *297/210* which is approximately *1.4142*. For any international **A-size paper** with short side equal to *b*, the longer side will always be *1.4142 × b*. So for *A4, b = 210 mm*, while for *A5, b = 148 mm*. The **A-formulae system** used for paper sizes has a highly desirable property, one that does not occur for arbitrary paper sizes. If an A-size piece of paper is folded about the middle, the two smaller rectangles formed are directly in proportion to the larger rectangle. They are two smaller versions of the same rectangle.

In this way, a piece of *A4* folded into two pieces generates two pieces of *A5*. Similarly a piece of *A5-size* paper generates two pieces of *A6*. In the other direction, a sheet of *A3 paper* is made up of two pieces of *A4*. The smaller the number on the A-size the larger the piece of paper. How did we know that the particular number *1.4142* would do the trick? Let’s fold a rectangle, but this time let’s make it one where we don’t know the length of its longer side. If we take the breadth of a rectangle to be *1* and we write the length of the longer side as *x*, then the length-to-width ratio is *x/1*. If we now fold the rectangle, the length-to-width ratio of the smaller rectangle is *1/½x*, which is the same as *2/x*. The point of A sizes is that our two ratios must stand for the same proportion, so we get an equation *x/1 = 2/x* or *x² = 2*. The true value of *x* is therefore **√2** which is approximately by *1.4142*.

## Mathematical gold

The **golden rectangle** is different, but only slightly different. This time the rectangle is folded along the line *RS* in the diagram so that the points *MRSQ* make up the corners of a square. The key property of the golden rectangle is that the rectangle left over, *RNPS*, is proportional to the large rectangle – what is left over should be a mini-replica of the large rectangle.

As before, we’ll say the breadth *MQ = MR* of the large rectangle is *1 unit* of length while we’ll write the length of the longer side *MN* as *x*. The length-to-width ratio is again *x/1*. This time the breadth of the smaller rectangle *RNPS* is *MN – MR*, which is *x− 1* so the length-to-width ratio of this rectangle is *1/(x – 1)*. By equating them, we get the equation

which can be multiplied out to give *x² = x + 1*. An approximate solution is *1.618*. We can easily check this. If you type *1.618* into a calculator and multiply it by itself you get *2.618* which is the same as *x + 1 = 2.618*. This number is the famous **golden ratio** and is designated by the Greek letter **phi**, **Φ**. Its definition and approximation is given by and this number is related to the **Fibonacci sequence** and the **rabbit problem** (see page 44).

## Going for gold

Now let’s see if we can build a golden rectangle. We’ll begin with our square *MQSR* with sides equal to *1 unit* and mark the midpoint of *QS* as *O*. The length *OS = ½*, and so by **Pythagoras’s theorem** (see page 84) in the triangle *ORS, OR*.

Using a pair of compasses centred on *O*, we can draw the arc *RP* and we’ll find that *OP = OR = √5/2*. So we end up with

which is what we wanted: the ‘**golden section**’ or the side of the golden rectangle.

## History

Much is claimed of the **golden ratio Φ**. Once its appealing mathematical properties are realized it is possible to see it in unexpected places, even in places where it is not. More than this is the danger of claiming the golden ratio was there before the artefact – that musicians, architects and artists had it in mind at the point of creation. This foible is termed ‘**golden numberism**’. The progress from numbers to general statements without other evidence is a dangerous argument to make.

Take the **Parthenon** in Athens. At its time of construction the golden ratio was certainly known but this does not mean that the Parthenon was based on it. Sure, in the front view of the Parthenon the ratio of the width to the height (including the triangular pediment) is *1.74* which is close to *1.618*, but is it close enough to claim the golden ratio as a motivation? Some argue that the pediment should be left out of the calculation, and if this is done, the width-to-height ratio is actually the whole number *3*.

In his *1509* book *De divina proportione*, **Luca Pacioli** ‘discovered’ connections between characteristics of God and properties of the proportion determined by **Φ**. He christened it the ‘**divine proportion**’. Pacioli was a Franciscan monk who wrote influential books on mathematics. By some he is regarded as the ‘**father of accounting**’ because he popularized the **double-entry method** of accounting used by Venetian merchants. His other claim to fame is that he taught mathematics to **Leonardo da Vinci**. In the **Renaissance**, the golden section achieved near mystical status – the astronomer **Johannes Kepler** described it as a mathematical ‘**precious jewel**’. Later, **Gustav Fechner**, a German experimental psychologist, made thousands of measurements of rectangular shapes (playing cards, books, windows) and found the most commonly occurring ratio of their sides was close to **Φ**.

**Le Corbusier** was fascinated by the rectangle as a central element in architectural design and by the golden rectangle in particular. He placed great emphasis on harmony and order and found this in mathematics. He saw architecture through the eyes of a mathematician. One of his planks was the ‘**modulator**’ system, a theory of proportions. In effect this was a way of generating streams of golden rectangles, shapes he used in his designs. Le Corbusier was inspired by **Leonardo da Vinci** who, in turn, had taken careful notes on the Roman architect **Vitruvius**, who set store by the proportions found in the human figure.

## Other shapes

There is also a ‘**supergolden rectangle**’ whose construction has similarities with the way the golden rectangle is constructed.

This is how we build the supergolden rectangle *MQPN*. As before, *MQSR* is a square whose side is of length *1*. Join the diagonal *MP* and mark the intersection on *RS* as the point *J*. Then make a line *JK* that’s parallel to *RN* with *K* on *NP*. We’ll say the length *RJ* is *y* and the length *MN* is *x*. For any rectangle, *RJ/MR = NP/MN* (because triangles *MRJ* and *MNP* are similar), so *y/1 = 1/x* which means *x × y = 1* and we say *x* and *y* are each other’s ‘**reciprocal**’. We get the supergolden rectangle by making the rectangle *RJKN* proportional to the original rectangle *MQPN*, that is *y/(x− 1) = x/1*. Using the fact that *xy = 1*, we can conclude that the length of the supergolden rectangle *x* is found by solving the ‘**cubic**’ equation *x³ = x² + 1*, which is clearly similar to the equation *x² = x + 1* (the equation that determines the golden rectangle). The cubic equation has one positive real solution **ψ** (replacing *x* with the more standard symbol **Φ**) whose value is

*ψ = 1.46557123187676802665...*

the number associated with the **cattle sequence** (see page 47). Whereas the golden rectangle can be constructed by a straight edge and a pair of compasses, the supergolden rectangle cannot be made this way.
