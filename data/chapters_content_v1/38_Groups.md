# 38 Groups

**Group theory** is a branch of **abstract algebra** that studies algebraic structures known as **groups**. A group is a set equipped with a **binary operation** that combines any two of its elements to form a third element, in a way that satisfies four fundamental axioms. Group theory is a powerful tool for understanding **symmetry**, and it has applications across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science.

## What is a Group?

A set *G* with a binary operation * (e.g., addition, multiplication) forms a group if it satisfies the following four axioms:

1.  **Closure:** For all elements *a, b* in *G*, the result of the operation *a * b* is also in *G*.
2.  **Associativity:** For all elements *a, b, c* in *G*, *(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)*.
3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element *e* in *G* (the identity element) such that for every element *a* in *G*, *a * e = e * a = a*.
4.  **Inverse Element:** For every element *a* in *G*, there exists an element *a⁻¹* in *G* (the inverse of *a*) such that *a * a⁻¹ = a⁻¹ * a = e*.

## Examples of Groups

*   **Integers under Addition (Z, +):** The set of all integers with the operation of addition forms a group. The identity element is *0*, and the inverse of any integer *a* is *-a*.
*   **Non-zero Rational Numbers under Multiplication (Q*, ×):** The set of all non-zero rational numbers with the operation of multiplication forms a group. The identity element is *1*, and the inverse of any rational number *a* is *1/a*.
*   **Symmetry Groups:** Groups are used to describe the symmetries of geometric objects. For example, the rotations of a square form a group.

## Subgroups and Cosets

*   **Subgroup:** A subset of a group that is itself a group under the same operation.
*   **Coset:** A concept related to subgroups that helps in understanding the structure of groups.

## Group Homomorphisms

A **group homomorphism** is a function between two groups that preserves the group structure. It maps the identity element to the identity element, and the inverse of an element to the inverse of its image.

## Applications of Group Theory

Group theory has a wide range of applications:

*   **Physics:** Describing symmetries in quantum mechanics, particle physics, and crystallography.
*   **Chemistry:** Understanding molecular structures and chemical reactions.
*   **Computer Science:** Cryptography (e.g., **elliptic curve cryptography**), **coding theory**, and algorithm design.
*   **Mathematics:** Fundamental to abstract algebra, number theory, and topology.
