# 34 Distributions

In **statistics**, a **distribution** describes the possible values a **random variable** can take and how often they occur. Understanding distributions is crucial for analyzing data, making inferences, and modeling real-world phenomena, from the heights of people to the outcomes of experiments.

## Types of Distributions

Distributions can be broadly categorized into two main types:

*   **Discrete Probability Distributions:** Describe the probabilities of outcomes for **discrete random variables** (variables that can only take on a finite or countably infinite number of values). Examples include:
    *   **Bernoulli Distribution:** For a single trial with two possible outcomes (e.g., success/failure).
    *   **Binomial Distribution:** For the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
    *   **Poisson Distribution:** For the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.

*   **Continuous Probability Distributions:** Describe the probabilities of outcomes for **continuous random variables** (variables that can take on any value within a given range). Examples include:
    *   **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** A symmetric, bell-shaped curve, widely used due to the **Central Limit Theorem**.
    *   **Uniform Distribution:** All outcomes within a given range are equally likely.
    *   **Exponential Distribution:** Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.

## Key Characteristics of Distributions

*   **Mean (Expected Value):** The average value of the random variable.
*   **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Measures of the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean.
*   **Skewness:** A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution.
*   **Kurtosis:** A measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)

*   For discrete distributions, the **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.
*   For continuous distributions, the **Probability Density Function (PDF)** describes the likelihood of the random variable taking on a given value. The area under the PDF curve over an interval gives the probability of the variable falling within that interval.

## Applications of Distributions

Distributions are fundamental to statistical analysis and modeling in various fields:

*   **Quality Control:** Monitoring manufacturing processes.
*   **Finance:** Modeling asset prices and risk.
*   **Biology:** Analyzing genetic variations and population dynamics.
*   **Social Sciences:** Understanding demographic patterns and survey results.
*   **Engineering:** Designing systems and predicting performance.

# Parameters for the Binomial Distribution
n_trials = 10  # Number of trials (e.g., coin flips)
p_success = 0.5 # Probability of success on each trial (e.g., probability of heads)

plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.xticks(range(n_trials + 1))
