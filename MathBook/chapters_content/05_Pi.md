# 05 Pi

**π** is the most famous number in mathematics. Forget all the other constants of nature, **π** will always come at the top of the list. If there were Oscars for numbers, **π** would get an award every year.

**π** or *pi*, is the length of the outside of a circle (the **circumference**) divided by the length across its centre (the **diameter**). Its value, the ratio of these two lengths, does not depend on the size of the circle. Whether the circle is big or small, **π** is indeed a **mathematical constant**. The circle is the natural habitat for **π** but it occurs everywhere in mathematics, and in places not remotely connected with the circle.

**For a circle of diameter d and radius r :**
circumference = **πd** = **2πr**
area = **πr²**

**For a sphere of diameter d and radius r :**
surface area = **πd²** = **4πr²**
volume = **4/3 πr³**

## Archimedes of Syracuse

The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle was a subject of ancient interest. Around *2000 BC* the Babylonians made the observation that the circumference was roughly *3 times* as long as its diameter.

It was **Archimedes of Syracuse** who made a real start on the mathematical theory of **π** in around *225 BC*. Archimedes is right up there with the greats. Mathematicians love to rate their co-workers and they place him on a level with **Carl Friedrich Gauss** (The ‘Prince of Mathematicians’) and **Sir Isaac Newton**. Whatever the merits of this judgment it is clear that Archimedes would be in any mathematics Hall of Fame. He was hardly an ivory tower figure though – as well as his contributions to astronomy, mathematics and physics, he also designed weapons of war, such as *catapults, levers* and ‘*burning mirrors*’, all used to help keep the Romans at bay. But by all accounts he did have something of the absent-mindedness of the professor, for what else would induce him to leap from his bath and run naked down the street shouting ‘**Eureka**’ at discovering the law of buoyancy in hydrostatics? How he celebrated his work on **π** is not recorded.

Given that **π** is defined as the ratio of its circumference to its diameter, what does it have to do with the area of a circle? It is a deduction that the area of a circle of radius *r* is **πr²**, though this is probably better known than the circumference/diameter definition of **π**. The fact that **π** does double duty for area and circumference is remarkable.

How can this be shown? The circle can be split up into a number of narrow equal triangles with base length *b* whose height is approximately the radius *r*. These form a polygon inside the circle which approximates the area of the circle. Let’s take *1000 triangles* for a start. The whole process is an exercise in approximations. We can join together each adjacent pair of these triangles to form a rectangle (approximately) with area *b × r* so that the total area of the polygon will be *500 × b × r*. As *500 × b* is about half the circumference it has length **πr**, the area of the polygon is *πr × r = πr²*. The more triangles we take the closer will be the approximation and in the limit we conclude the area of the circle is **πr²**.

Archimedes estimated the value of **π** as bounded between and. And so it is to Archimedes that we owe the familiar approximation **22/7** for the value of **π**. The honour for designating the actual symbol **π** goes to the little known **William Jones**, a Welsh mathematician who became Vice President of the Royal Society of London in the 18th century. It was the mathematician and physicist **Leonhard Euler** who popularized **π** in the context of the circle ratio.

## The exact value of π

We can never know the exact value of **π** because it is an **irrational number**, a fact proved by **Johann Lambert** in *1768*. The decimal expansion is infinite with no predictable pattern. The first *20 decimal places* are *3.14159265358979323846...*. The value of **√10** used by the Chinese mathematicians is *3.16227766016837933199* and this was adopted around *AD 500* by Brahmagupta. This value is in fact little better than than the crude value of *3* and it differs in the second decimal place from **π**.

**π** can be computed from a series of numbers. A well known one is though this is painfully slow in its convergence on **π** and quite hopeless for calculation. Euler found a remarkable series that converges to **π**:

The self-taught genius **Srinivasa Ramanujan** devised some spectacular approximating formulae for **π**. One involving only the square root of *2* is:

Mathematicians are fascinated by **π**. While Lambert had proved it could not be a fraction, in *1882* the German mathematician **Ferdinand von Lindemann** solved the most outstanding problem associated with **π**. He showed that **π** is ‘**transcendental**’; that is, **π** cannot be the solution of an algebraic equation (an equation which only involves powers of *x*). By solving this ‘riddle of the ages’ Lindemann concluded the problem of ‘**squaring the circle**’. Given a circle the challenge was to construct a square of the same area using only a pair of compasses and a straight edge. Lindemann proved conclusively that it cannot be done. Nowadays the phrase *squaring the circle* is the equivalent of an impossibility.

The actual calculation of **π** continued apace. In *1853*, **William Shanks** claimed a value correct to *607 places* (actually correct up to only *527*). In modern times the quest for calculating **π** to more and more decimal places gained momentum through the modern computer. In *1949*, **π** was calculated to *2037 decimal places*, which took *70 hours* to do on an **ENIAC** computer. By *2002*, **π** had been computed to a staggering *1,241,100,000,000 places*, but it is an ever growing tail. If we stood on the equator and started writing down the expansion of **π**, Shanks’ calculation would take us a full *14 metres*, but the length of the *2002* expansion would take us about *62 laps around the world*!

Various questions about **π** have been asked and answered. Are the digits of **π** random? Is it possible to find a predetermined sequence in the expansion? For instance, is it possible to find the sequence *0123456789* in the expansion? In the *1950s* this seemed unknowable. No one had found such a sequence in the *2000* known digits of **π**. **L.E.J. Brouwer**, a leading Dutch mathematician, said the question was devoid of meaning since he believed it could not be experienced. In fact these digits were found in *1997* beginning at the position *17,387,594,880*, or, using the equator metaphor, about *3000 miles* before one lap is completed. You will find *ten sixes in a row* before you have completed *600 miles* but will have to wait until one lap has been completed and gone a further *3600 miles* to find *ten sevens in a row*.

**π** in poetry
If you really want to remember the first values in the expansion of **π** perhaps a little poetry will help. Following the tradition of teaching mathematics in the ‘mnemonic way’ there is a brilliant variation of **Edgar Allen Poe’s** poem ‘*The Raven*’ by **Michael Keith**.

**The letter count of each successive word in Keith’s version provides the first 740 digits of π**.

## The importance of π

What is the use of knowing **π** to so many places? After all, most calculations only require a few decimal places; probably no more than *ten places* are needed for any practical application, and Archimedes’ approximation of **22/7** is good enough for most. But the extensive calculations are not just for fun. They are used to test the limits of computers, besides exerting a fascination on the group of mathematicians who have called themselves the ‘**friends of pi**’.

Perhaps the strangest episode in the story of **π** was the attempt in the **Indiana State Legislature** to pass a bill that would fix its value. This occurred at the end of the *19th century* when a medical doctor **Dr E.J. Goodwin** introduced the bill to make **π** ‘digestible’. A practical problem encountered in this piece of legislation was the proposer’s inability to fix the value he wanted. Happily for Indiana, the folly of legislating on **π** was realized before the bill was fully.
