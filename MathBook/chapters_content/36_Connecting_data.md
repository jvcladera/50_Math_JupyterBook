# 36 Connecting data

**Connecting data**, often through **statistical analysis**, is crucial for uncovering relationships, identifying patterns, and making predictions from observations. From simple **correlations** to complex **regression models**, the ability to analyze and interpret data is fundamental to scientific discovery, business intelligence, and informed decision-making.

## Correlation

**Correlation** measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. It is typically represented by the **correlation coefficient** (*r*), which ranges from *-1* to *+1*:

*   **+1:** Perfect positive linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other increases proportionally).
*   **-1:** Perfect negative linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other decreases proportionally).
*   **0:** No linear relationship.

It's important to remember that correlation does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated doesn't mean one causes the other.

## Regression Analysis

**Regression analysis** is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The most common type is **linear regression**, which attempts to model the relationship using a straight line.

**Simple Linear Regression:** Models the relationship between two variables (one dependent, one independent) using the equation of a straight line:

`y = mx + b`

Where:
*   `y` is the dependent variable
*   `x` is the independent variable
*   `m` is the slope of the line (change in y for a unit change in x)
*   `b` is the y-intercept (value of y when x is 0)

The goal of linear regression is to find the line that best fits the data, minimizing the distance between the observed data points and the regression line.

## Data Visualization

Visualizing data is a critical step in connecting data. **Scatter plots** are commonly used to display the relationship between two variables, making it easier to spot trends, outliers, and the strength of correlation.

## Applications

Connecting data through statistical methods has widespread applications:

*   **Business:** Predicting sales, analyzing customer behavior, optimizing marketing campaigns.
*   **Healthcare:** Identifying risk factors for diseases, evaluating treatment effectiveness.
*   **Environmental Science:** Modeling climate change, predicting natural disasters.
*   **Social Sciences:** Understanding demographic patterns and survey results.
*   **Engineering:** Predicting material properties, optimizing system performance.

# Python demo: Calculating Correlation and Simple Linear Regression

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import pearsonr, linregress

# Sample data: X (e.g., hours studied), Y (e.g., exam score)
X = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
Y = np.array([50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90])

print(f"X values: {X}")
print(f"Y values: {Y}")

# 1. Calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficient
correlation_coefficient, _ = pearsonr(X, Y)
print(f"\nPearson Correlation Coefficient (r): {correlation_coefficient:.3f}")

# 2. Perform Simple Linear Regression
slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(X, Y)

print(f"\nLinear Regression Results:")
print(f"  Slope (m): {slope:.3f}")
print(f"  Y-intercept (b): {intercept:.3f}")
print(f"  R-squared: {r_value**2:.3f}") # R-squared is the square of the correlation coefficient

# Predict Y values based on the regression line
predicted_Y = slope * X + intercept

# 3. Visualize the data and regression line
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X, Y, color='blue', label='Actual Data')
plt.plot(X, predicted_Y, color='red', label='Regression Line')
plt.title('Simple Linear Regression')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
