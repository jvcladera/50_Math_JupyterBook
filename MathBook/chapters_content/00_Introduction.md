# 00 Introduction

Mathematics is a vast subject and no one can possibly know it all. What one can do is explore and find an *individual pathway*. The possibilities open to us here will lead to other times and different cultures and to ideas that have intrigued mathematicians for centuries.

Mathematics is both ancient and modern and is built up from widespread cultural and political influences. From India and Arabia we derive our modern numbering system, but it is one tempered with historical barnacles. The **‘base 60’** of the Babylonians of two or three millennia BC shows up in our own culture – we have 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour; a right angle is still 90 degrees and not 100 grads as revolutionary France adopted in a first move towards decimalization.

The technological triumphs of the modern age depend on mathematics, and surely there is no longer any pride left in announcing to have been no good at it when at school. Of course, school mathematics is a different thing, often taught with an eye to examinations. The *time pressure* of school does not help either, for mathematics is a subject where there is **no merit in being fast**. People need time to allow the ideas to sink in. Some of the greatest mathematicians have been painfully slow as they strove to understand the deep concepts of their subject.

There is no hurry with this book. It can be *dipped into at leisure*. Take your time and discover what these ideas you may have heard of really mean. Beginning with **Zero**, or elsewhere if you wish, you can move on a trip between islands of mathematical ideas. For instance, you can become knowledgeable about **Game theory** and next read about **Magic squares**. Alternatively, you can move from **Golden rectangles** to the famous **Fermat’s last theorem**, or any other path.

This is an exciting time for mathematics. Some of its major problems have been solved in recent times. Modern computing developments have helped with some but been helpless against others. The **Four-colour problem** was solved with the aid of a computer, but the **Riemann hypothesis**, the final chapter of the book, remains unsolved – by computer or any other means.

Mathematics is for all. The popularity of **Sudoku** is evidence that people can do mathematics (without knowing it) and enjoy it too. In mathematics, like art or music, there have been the geniuses, but theirs is not the whole story. You will see several leaders making entrances and exits in some chapters only to reappear in others. **Leonhard Euler**, whose tercentenary occurs in 2007, is a frequent visitor to these pages. But, real progress in mathematics is the work of ‘the many’ accumulated over centuries. The choice of 50 topics is a personal one, but I have tried to keep a balance. There are everyday and advanced items, pure and applied mathematics, abstract and concrete, the old and the new. Mathematics, though, is one united subject, and the difficulty in writing has not been in choosing topics, but in leaving some out. There could have been 500 ideas, but 50 are enough for a good beginning to your mathematical career.
