## 27 The parallel postulate

**Euclid's parallel postulate, one of the five axioms of Euclidean geometry, states that through a point not on a given line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line. For centuries, mathematicians attempted to prove this postulate from the other four, leading to the revolutionary discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, which profoundly changed our understanding of space and the nature of mathematical truth.**

### Euclid's Five Postulates

Euclid's *Elements*, written around 300 BC, laid the foundation for geometry for over two millennia. It begins with five postulates:

1.  A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.
2.  A straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
3.  A circle can be drawn with any given center and radius.
4.  All right angles are congruent.
5.  If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles. (This is the parallel postulate).

### The Quest to Prove the Parallel Postulate

For nearly two thousand years, mathematicians tried to prove the parallel postulate from the first four, believing it to be a theorem rather than an independent axiom. Many attempted proofs were put forward, but all were eventually found to contain flaws or implicitly assume the postulate itself.

### The Birth of Non-Euclidean Geometries

The failure to prove the parallel postulate led mathematicians to consider what would happen if it were false. This line of inquiry, pursued independently by mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss, JÃ¡nos Bolyai, and Nikolai Lobachevsky in the 19th century, led to the development of non-Euclidean geometries:

*   **Hyperbolic Geometry (Lobachevskian Geometry):** Through a point not on a given line, there are *infinitely many* lines parallel to the given line. This geometry is characterized by negative curvature, like a saddle.
*   **Elliptic Geometry (Riemannian Geometry):** Through a point not on a given line, there are *no* lines parallel to the given line. This geometry is characterized by positive curvature, like the surface of a sphere.

### Implications and Significance

The discovery of non-Euclidean geometries had profound implications:

*   **Challenged Mathematical Certainty:** It showed that mathematical truths are not necessarily absolute but depend on the underlying axioms. Different sets of axioms can lead to equally valid, but different, geometries.
*   **Revolutionized Physics:** Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity uses non-Euclidean geometry (specifically Riemannian geometry) to describe the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
*   **Expanded Mathematical Horizons:** Opened up new avenues of research in geometry and other branches of mathematics.
