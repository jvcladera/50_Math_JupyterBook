## 28 Discrete geometry

**Discrete geometry is a branch of geometry that studies combinatorial properties of discrete geometric objects. Unlike classical geometry, which deals with continuous shapes, discrete geometry focuses on finite or countable sets of points, lines, circles, and other geometric entities. It has strong connections to combinatorics, computer science, and optimization.**

### Key Concepts

*   **Points, Lines, and Planes:** In discrete geometry, these are often considered as finite sets of objects rather than continuous entities.
*   **Combinatorial Properties:** Focuses on how these objects can be arranged and combined, and the relationships between them.
*   **Lattice Points:** Points with integer coordinates in a coordinate system. These are fundamental in many discrete geometry problems.
*   **Convex Hulls:** The smallest convex set that contains a given set of points. Imagine stretching a rubber band around a set of nails.
*   **Voronoi Diagrams:** Partitions a plane into regions based on proximity to a set of points. Each region consists of all points closer to one specific point than to any other.
*   **Triangulations:** Dividing a geometric object (like a polygon) into a set of triangles.

### Problems in Discrete Geometry

Discrete geometry addresses a variety of problems, including:

*   **Packing Problems:** How to arrange objects (e.g., circles, spheres) in a given space to maximize density.
*   **Covering Problems:** How to cover a given space with a set of objects.
*   **Visibility Problems:** Determining which parts of a scene are visible from a given viewpoint.
*   **Counting Problems:** Counting the number of possible arrangements or configurations of geometric objects.

### Applications

Discrete geometry has numerous practical applications:

*   **Computer Graphics:** For rendering, collision detection, and mesh generation.
*   **Computational Geometry:** Algorithms for solving geometric problems efficiently.
*   **Operations Research:** Optimization problems in logistics, facility location, and network design.
*   **Robotics:** Path planning and obstacle avoidance.
*   **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** Spatial analysis and data representation.

```python
# Python demo: Counting lattice points in a rectangle

# This example demonstrates a simple concept in discrete geometry:
# counting points with integer coordinates within a defined region.

def count_lattice_points_in_rectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Assumes x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2
    # Counts points (x, y) where x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2
    # and x, y are integers.
    count = 0
    for x in range(int(x1), int(x2) + 1):
        for y in range(int(y1), int(y2) + 1):
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
rect_x1, rect_y1 = 0, 0
rect_x2, rect_y2 = 3, 2

num_points = count_lattice_points_in_rectangle(rect_x1, rect_y1, rect_x2, rect_y2)
print(f"Number of lattice points in rectangle from ({rect_x1},{rect_y1}) to ({rect_x2},{rect_y2}): {num_points}")

# Python demo: Conceptual representation of a convex hull (points)

# This is a conceptual representation. Actual convex hull algorithms are more complex.
# Libraries like SciPy or Shapely can compute convex hulls.

def conceptual_convex_hull(points):
    print("\nConceptual Convex Hull:")
    print(f"Given points: {points}")
    print("The convex hull would be the smallest convex polygon enclosing these points.")
    print("For example, if points are corners of a square, the hull is the square itself.")

# Example usage:
example_points = [(0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,0), (0.5, 0.5)]
conceptual_convex_hull(example_points)
